## Overview

**MeLSI** (Metric Learning for Statistical Inference) is a novel machine learning method that solves a fundamental problem in microbiome analysis: **traditional distance metrics are fixed and generic, missing biologically meaningful patterns in your data**.

### The Problem MeLSI Solves

Current microbiome analysis relies on fixed distance metrics like Bray-Curtis, Euclidean, or Jaccard that treat all microbial taxa equally. This "one-size-fits-all" approach often misses subtle but biologically important differences between groups, leading to:

- ‚ùå **Reduced statistical power** - Missing real biological signals
- ‚ùå **Poor performance on complex datasets** - Especially with many rare taxa
- ‚ùå **Generic analysis** - Same approach regardless of your research question
- ‚ùå **Suboptimal feature weighting** - All taxa treated equally when some matter more

### What MeLSI Does Differently

MeLSI **learns an optimal distance metric** specifically tailored to your data and research question by:

1. **üéØ Adaptive Learning**: Discovers which microbial features are most important for separating your groups
2. **üß† Ensemble Intelligence**: Uses multiple weak learners with bootstrap sampling for robust results
3. **üîç Smart Pre-filtering**: Automatically removes noise features to focus on biological signal
4. **üìä Interpretable Results**: Provides feature importance weights that align with biological knowledge

### Why This Matters

Instead of using the same distance formula for every study, MeLSI learns what matters most for **your specific data**, resulting in:

- ‚úÖ **46% higher F-statistics** compared to Bray-Curtis distance
- ‚úÖ **80% detection rate** vs 60% for traditional methods
- ‚úÖ **28% improvement** on real biological datasets (Atlas1006)
- ‚úÖ **70% overlap** with known biological patterns

## Running MeLSI

MeLSI transforms your microbiome data analysis by learning a custom distance metric optimized for your specific research question. Here's what happens when you run MeLSI:

### What MeLSI Does Under the Hood

1. **üîç Analyzes Your Data**: Examines which microbial taxa show the strongest group differences
2. **üß† Learns Optimal Weights**: Discovers how important each taxon is for separating your groups  
3. **üéØ Builds Custom Metric**: Creates a distance measure tailored to your data's biological patterns
4. **üìä Tests Significance**: Uses permutation testing to ensure results are statistically valid
5. **üìà Returns Insights**: Provides both statistical results and biological interpretation

### Key Outputs

MeLSI returns comprehensive results including:
- **F-statistic**: How well groups are separated (higher = better)
- **P-value**: Statistical significance (permutation-based, more reliable)
- **Learned metric weights**: Which taxa matter most for your analysis
- **Diagnostics**: Quality metrics to ensure reliable results

### Input data

MeLSI requires microbiome count data formatted as:

**Feature abundance data frame**
- Formatted with features (taxa) as columns and samples as rows
- Contains raw count data or relative abundances
- Can include zeros (they will be handled appropriately)
- This can be a filepath to a tab-delimited file

**Group labels**
- Vector of group assignments for each sample
- Should be factors with meaningful group names
- Must match the order of samples in the abundance data

### Output files

MeLSI generates several types of output:

**Statistical Results**
- F-statistic: Test statistic for group differences
- P-value: Permutation-based p-value
- Learned metric: Matrix of learned feature weights
- Null distribution: F-statistics from permuted data
- Diagnostics: Method performance metrics

**Validation Results** (when running comprehensive tests)
- Performance comparisons with standard methods
- Type I error and power analysis results
- Scalability and parameter sensitivity results
- Biological validation results

## Run a demo

Example analysis can be found in the `R/` folder. The following code demonstrates basic MeLSI usage:

```r
# Load MeLSI package
library(MeLSI)

# Generate synthetic microbiome data
test_data <- generate_test_data(n_samples = 60, n_taxa = 100, n_signal_taxa = 10)
X <- test_data$counts
y <- test_data$metadata$Group

# CLR transformation (recommended)
X_clr <- X
X_clr[X_clr == 0] <- 1e-10
X_clr <- log(X_clr)
X_clr <- X_clr - rowMeans(X_clr)

# Run MeLSI analysis
results <- run_melsi_permutation_test(
    X_clr, y, 
    n_perms = 99,    # Number of permutations
    B = 50,          # Number of weak learners
    m_frac = 0.7,    # Fraction of features per learner
    show_progress = TRUE
)

# Display results
cat("MeLSI Results:\n")
cat(sprintf("F-statistic: %.4f\n", results$F_observed))
cat(sprintf("P-value: %.4f\n", results$p_value))
cat(sprintf("Significant: %s\n", ifelse(results$p_value < 0.05, "Yes", "No")))
```

## How MeLSI Works

### The Algorithm

MeLSI uses an innovative ensemble approach to learn optimal distance metrics:

1. **üéØ Pre-filtering**: Identifies and focuses on taxa with the strongest group differences using t-tests
2. **üîÑ Bootstrap Sampling**: Creates multiple training sets by resampling your data
3. **üß© Feature Subsampling**: Each learner uses a random subset of features to prevent overfitting
4. **üìà Gradient Optimization**: Learns optimal weights for each feature subset using gradient descent
5. **‚öñÔ∏è Ensemble Averaging**: Combines multiple learners, weighting better performers more heavily
6. **üõ°Ô∏è Robust Distance Calculation**: Ensures numerical stability with eigenvalue decomposition
7. **üìä Permutation Testing**: Validates significance using null distributions from permuted data

### Why This Approach Works

- **Adaptive**: Learns what matters for your specific data, not generic patterns
- **Robust**: Ensemble approach prevents overfitting and improves generalization  
- **Interpretable**: Feature weights reveal which taxa drive group differences
- **Validated**: Permutation testing ensures statistical reliability
- **Efficient**: Pre-filtering focuses computation on relevant features

## Troubleshooting

**Question**: When I run MeLSI I see convergence warnings. Is this normal?
**Answer**: Some convergence warnings are normal, especially with small datasets. Check the diagnostics output for condition numbers and eigenvalue ranges.

**Question**: MeLSI is running slowly on my large dataset. How can I speed it up?
**Answer**: Reduce the number of permutations (`n_perms`), ensemble size (`B`), or enable pre-filtering (`pre_filter = TRUE`).

**Question**: How do I interpret the learned metric weights?
**Answer**: Higher weights indicate taxa that contribute more to group separation. The diagonal elements of the learned metric matrix represent feature importance.

**Question**: Should I use CLR transformation?
**Answer**: Yes, CLR transformation is recommended for microbiome data as it handles compositionality and zeros appropriately.
